## Frameworks used for generating images

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/es/) (OpenSource - [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)): we used Inkscape to create the project logo. On fires instance we used Canva, but upon reading the Terms of use and license we thought we could have some licesing problems with some of the elements we were using. It is true that in principle there should be no problem, but we prefer to use Inkscape because it is open source.
- Logo -> Icons used MIT license, taken from React Bootstrap Icons
- Font -> The logo uses Protest Riot font and the web page uses Open Sans. Both have OFL license, that allows their use in any type of projects.

## Our license

Aiming to avoid conflicts we opted for the MIT license since we mostly seek that our project is simple and open. We thoroughly checked all our depedencies and software used in the development of our project in order to reach this conclusion.
